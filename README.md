This is for Crowdtainer's own use and to help others get up and running quickly with their projects.

## Instructions
Set the variables in config.env.example then rename it to config.env.

Tip: For development, you can use the domain 'localhost' in your config.env, which will disable SSL/certificates.

Create the required volumes and run docker:

```sh
docker volume create --name=nginx_conf
docker volume create --name=letsencrypt_certs

docker-compose --env-file config.env up --build

#docker compose up -d --build
#docker compose logs -f
```

Now configure the Wordpress site by opening localhost in your browser, or using wp-cli tool, e.g.:


```sh
docker-compose --env-file config.env run --rm wp-cli user list
```

Once everything is as desired, you can use the "vackup.sh" script to save the volumes and reload it in your production server:

```sh
# source machine:
./vackup export VOLUME FILE // Creates a gziped tarball in current directory from a volume

# target machine:
./vackup import FILE VOLUME // Extracts a gziped tarball into a volume
```

## Running in production:

If necessary, re-create the volume for Let's Encrypt certificates:

```sh
# Destroy the cert bot container and volume
docker volume rm letsencrypt_certs
docker volume create --name=letsencrypt_certs
```

Change the CERTBOT_TEST_CERT value to 0 in config.env.

Start the containers:

```sh
docker-compose --env-file config.env up --build
# OR
docker-compose up -d --env-file config.env
```

To do hot reload of nginx configuration:
```sh
docker compose exec --no-TTY nginx nginx -s reload
```
